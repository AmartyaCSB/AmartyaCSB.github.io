I used to think LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) was just another efficient fine-tuning trick, until I actually worked with it in an end-to-end CV pipeline. LoRA isn’t just efficient. It changes how we think about model ownership and modularity.

For those unfamiliar or only surface-level familiar: LoRA lets you fine-tune large models without touching their original weights. Instead, it adds tiny low-rank matrices (parameter-efficient adapters) into the transformer blocks. You only train those new components, which is often less than 1% of the full model size. What surprised me most wasn’t just how much GPU memory it saved, it was how cleanly it decouples task-specific logic from the base model. No need to clone entire models or worry about catastrophic forgetting.

In my case, I was adapting a foundation model for a highly specialized visual task where data was limited and compute even more so. Full fine-tuning wasn’t practical. LoRA made experimentation lightweight, reproducible, and swappable. Each adapter became like a modular plug-in for a new use case. It reminded me of how transfer learning felt when it first became mainstream, except now it’s truly scalable.

What I’m still curious about: how well LoRA holds up under continual learning scenarios, or whether it's viable for on-device fine-tuning in low-power edge deployments. Also, what’s the future after LoRA?
Would love to hear how others are applying (or moving beyond) LoRA, especially in computer vision, edge AI, or multimodal settings.
